Use redgold-cli primarily if adding a new command that'll be reused frequently. These shell 
scripts in this directory are either for direct CI invocation, manual debugging, or for dev 
only purposes. They are not intended to be used by end users. They're kept separate 
mainly for organizational purposes, rather than building a giant single shell script.
