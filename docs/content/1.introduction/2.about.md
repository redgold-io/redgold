## What is Redgold?

Redgold is a peer to peer crypto-currency / blockchain with a focus on exposing database 
functionality to application developers.

## What inspired this?

The first motivating problem is that of the social proof issue with conventional networks. Blockchains are meant to 
provide security in an open context, but that security primarily derives from the socially accepted active software 
fork and chain data hash. PoW and PoS blockchains frequently discard the chain data to switch software versions, 
make manual revisions, or otherwise determine what is the "correct" network.

This process is extremely arbitrary, error-prone, subject to manipulation and attacks, and otherwise manual. 
Local peer decisions based on scores (even if manually calculated) are the ultimate arbiter of security. 
This process can benefit from inference and automation.

Additionally, as the end goal per transaction is simply a merkle proof associated with acceptance from 
the prior mentioned peers, there is no need for a sophisticated chain data structure. It can be eliminated 
& optimized away entirely, and only the final stage produced directly, yielding a "local" or relative 
model of security & validation

The second motivating problem is oriented around scaling issues associated with smart contracts & support 
for database-like interactions. Blockchain is conventionally treated as an open world database, but operations 
are expressed as state transitions associated with a single contract. This would be the equivalent of 
serializing a class as a blob in a database, reloading it and executing functions against it for a 
conventional application -- something that ignores proper data store design considerations entirely.


The third motivating problem is issues associated with DeFi & bridge design. Most "trustless" bridges 
obfuscate a serious security issue across networks, which is the inability to re-validate the state associated 
with a given blockchain. This is a fundamental limitation with being unable to run an entire node within the 
contract of another platform or network, and is unlikely to soon change. That limit creates a situation where 
the subset of peers which provide state information to the given contract, are themselves providing the security.

This ends up degenerating down to a similar risk profile as a multi-signature custodial group. There are some 
variations, but it fundamentally shares a great degree of commonality. The problem of course with these types of 
models, is that there are numerous potential groupings of peers, as seen by wrapper coins backed by central 
companies, competing wrapper coins on the same platform, and different contract implementations. All of this is 
a byproduct of attempting to mitigate risk with different designs, but it hints at a potential design constraint.

The correct model to represent this is again, a local or relative one. As security is determined by peers, and 
each peer may have a different risk profile rating of other peers, the ideal wrapper is actually a custom weighted 
portfolio of different bridge providers. This property extends as well to more complicated cases, such as ETFs and 
portfolio target models / contracts.
