#### Why bake a product into a platform?

Regarding ETF-like functionality: given the number of crypto related platforms, it's pretty difficult to attract 
users and applications to adopt something new. Even with a better design or offering, it's still a challenge to 
grow from scratch without a compelling use case. Furthermore, having a defined objective helps to focus the 
platform development towards a specific goal, and provides a clear path for users to follow.

This area is particularly underserved by existing platforms. It's difficult to achieve this sort of functionality 
out of the box in the context of other crypto systems, and it's a desirable use for many people. This objective 
highlights a lot of problems and issues related to the core designs of most existing platforms, and additionally 
allows the major components of the solution to be built before being extended to other use cases. While larger 
platforms have the resources to focus entirely on the platform, starting from scratch means designing around a 
use case and building from there.

Additionally, and perhaps an even stronger motivation, is that there is already this strange sort of separation 
that happens between platform-level features (for example, native ETH transactions) and application-level features. (For example, an ERC-20 transaction.) This separation is done for obvious reasons, in the sense that many ERC-20s need 
substantial customization, and it's not feasible to bake all of that into the platform. 

However, there are many 
common use cases that CAN be supported at the platform level, and doing so from a common unified schema makes 
everyone's lives easier in terms of maintaining common standards and interop. While ERC-20 does draw from a common 
interface, it doesn't offer as much power as a schema level solution, whereas here we are simply adding additional 
fields to the standard transaction type to indicate a productId (ERC-20 Id equivalent.) With additional fields for 
more executable definitions, this allows all currencies to follow common schema patterns and make integrations much 
simpler. For the same reason, many common products should actually be built directly into the platform, when 
they are important enough to justify this level of standardization.

#### Why are there mentions of trust? I thought trust-less systems are better?

There's no such thing as a trust-less system, that is primarily a marketing term rather than a technical reality. 
Even the origin for the term trust-less in commercial network security and military applications really focuses 
heavily around the notion of simply finer-grained permissions & access control & user logins, rather than actually 
eliminating the notion of trust. It's way better to be absolutely explicit about what is trusted, how much, and build 
a real model to minimize the sources of trust in order to provide transparent and clear security guarantees. 

Obfuscation of hidden layers of trust is a dangerous thing, as it leads to people trusting things they shouldn't. 
And one of the most fundamental principles of security is that security by obfuscation is not security. In 
other sections, there are more detailed explanations for the hidden sources of trust that seep in to many existing 
crypto systems or platforms, and we are trying to make all of them absolutely explicit and clear. And taking a 
data-driven design towards dealing with human inputs & ratings associated with trust information, in order to 
provide a stronger guarantee of security in critically weak areas. Many areas of the design around model calculation 
are re-applied from other areas of research towards related problems mostly associated with graph embeddings and 
recommendation systems applied in commercial industry, and repurposed towards the problem of trust & reputation 
in the context of conflicting values & a peer-to-peer network. While many reputation systems exist in p2p systems 
for reliability use cases (and some minor ones for security use cases,) this is an attempt at a more general 
purpose system that can be applied to a wider range of use cases.
