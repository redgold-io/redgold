# AMM Swaps & Exchanges

This guide will explain the basics of using Redgold's native swap AMMs to exchange Redgold for other assets, as well 
as some brief information on how they work, if you are more comfortable in purchasing wrapped assets on another 
network, this will contain the links and addresses of approved wrapper tokens.

#### Wrapper Tokens

RDG is available on Ethereum Mainnet via this PancakeSwap liquidity pool with a 0.01% fee (lowest possible.)
https://pancakeswap.finance/liquidity/14366?chain=eth

To execute a swap, please navigate to: 
https://pancakeswap.finance/?outputCurrency=0xb7F964684AFd11baEed81ff433F6701b701Ea16E?chain=eth

Please ensure you double check the links and addresses before sending any funds, as this token contract:
https://etherscan.io/token/0xb7f964684afd11baeed81ff433f6701b701ea16e is the only officially approved Redgold 
ERC-20. It will be natively redeemable for RDG on the Redgold network via bridge, or can be held in perpetuity 
on Ethereum Mainnet.


#### What are native swaps?

Native swaps are a type of automated market maker (AMM) that allows users to swap one asset for another, using a 
multiparty encryption scheme for a group of nodes to hold the keys to the underlying assets being swapped. 
This allows for avoiding the use of wrapper tokens and trusted intermediaries. Liquidity is provided to the 
multiparty group in a permissionless fashion, and the execution of swap requests and overall stake determines the 
current price automatically.

#### What do I need to know to execute a swap?

The most important concept to understand before attempting a swap, is that you must have direct access to the keys 
or mnemonics used to generate the source address of the funds. This is because the output of the swap is sent 
directly to the corresponding address of the source funds, and can only be unlocked by a signature from the exact 
same key that was used to send the funds.

This feature is primarily intended for ease-of-use and security, as Redgold can reconstruct Bitcoin and other 
addresses the same way to verify signatures. Simply having access to a key that sends funds to an AMM is the criteria 
for unlocking the funds on the other side.

In the future, more complex swapping parameters will be supported for arbitrary key changes during exchange, but 
this requires a multi-transaction workflow with additional fees, for now, this is the simplest recommended path 
to follow.

#### How can I execute a swap?

Currently, only BTC/RDG pools are supported. To execute a swap, navigate to the Explorer page corresponding to the 
environment of interest: [Redgold Dev Explorer](https://dev.explorer.redgold.io/) or [Redgold Mainnet Explorer](https://explorer.redgold.io/) 
for example, and look at the top of the page for the current recommended BTC/RDG pool address. Click on that. 

Using this page, you can view the current estimated AMM order book, as well as calculate a preview of a trade 
showing the exact expected exchange rate. Simply sending any funds to this address in BTC will result in the receipt 
of RDG at the current AMM rate, received at the same 'address' that sent the BTC.

#### How do I spend the funds I receive?

The wallet software, so long as it contains the same key, will automatically allow you to spend the funds received 
to any valid address. We recognize address formats from multiple networks, and allow signature verification against 
any output address type.

### Example Walk Through From the UI

This workflow can be tested on dev, staging, and test environments before attempting on mainnet to ensure you 
understand the process. The following steps are a basic example of how to execute a swap using the Redgold wallet.

All non-mainnet environments use Bitcoin testnet funds, please find an appropriate faucet to obtain testnet funds. 
A Redgold faucet is provided on the explorer page as well. 

Please see the [Redgold Wallet Guide](/guides/wallet) for more details on how to setup keys, once setup, you can 
view the corresponding Bitcoin address to your hot wallet key, and hot wallet Bitcoin transactions are supported
(cold are not yet.) Here is an example of a singular key that holds BTC, RDG, and ETH and is sending BTC using 
the Redgold wallet to the AMM swap address

In here, we have sent a tiny amount of Bitcoin testnet funds to the dev AMM swap address found on the explorer page. 

By then viewing the explorer page and searching for our corresponding BTC source address, we should see an 
incoming transaction from the AMM sent on the Redgold network but with a spendable address of the BTC original 
source address. This allows us to spend it using the same key, and the Redgold wallet will automatically recognize 
these funds.
